/// There are 3 components to an operation, outside of the code to that runs the workflow itself.

/// 2. The error type it throws.
/// 3. It's dependencies (including isolation).
///
/// The first 2 components are implemented via that ``Value`` and ``Failure`` associated types
/// respectively.
///
/// The 3rd component is implemented via the ``OperationContext`` and isolation parameter passed to

/// represents the current actor-isolation context that the operation is running in.
///
/// Since operations are descriptions of workflows, this enables a world of functionallity that
/// can be implemented on top of a conformance to this protocol. The
/// ``OperationModifier`` protocol allows one to define extensible behavior on top of an operation
/// such as retries, deduplication, and much more.

// MARK: - StatefulOperationRequest

/// An immutable description of asynchronous work that has state associated with it.
///
/// Stateful operations benefit from a dedicated state management system provided by the library.
/// This system comprises of types such as ``OperationStore``, which manages the state for a stateful
/// operation, and ``OperationClient``, which manages a pool of operation stores.
///
/// Additionally, many modifiers are available in the library that declaratively describe
/// processes to manage the state of an operation. For instance the
/// ``StatefulOperationRequest/rerunOnChange(of:)`` modifier describes when an operation should
/// be rerun based on the statisfication of an ``OperationRunSpecification``.
///
/// The library provides 3 base operation protocols that inherit from this protocol.
/// 1. ``QueryRequest`` describes operations that simply fetch a value in its entirety.
/// 2. ``PaginatedRequest`` describes operations that paginated their results.
/// 3. ``MutationRequest`` describes operations that create, update, or delete data asynchronously
/// (eg. An HTTP POST request).
///
/// This protocol requires an operation to define the type of state that it manages. This type must
/// conform to the ``OperationState`` protocol. ``QueryRequest``, ``PaginatedRequest``, and
/// ``MutationRequest`` have concrete state types that are defined for you, so you will not need
/// to specify a state type when confoming your operation to any of those protocols.
///
/// Since many operation stores are managed within an `OperationClient`, your operation type needs
/// to be uniquely identifiable in order to retrieve the appropriate store within the client. This
/// is implemented through the ``path-6fsa8`` property, which requires you to provide an
/// ``OperationPath`` that uniquely identifies your operation. The path is a special type that
/// enables prefix based pattern matching, see <doc:PatternMatchingAndStateManagement> for more. If
/// your operation conforms to Identifiable or Hashable, the path requirement has a default
/// implementation that uses the identity or hashability of your operation respectively.
public protocol StatefulOperationRequest<State>: OperationRequest
where Value: Sendable, State.OperationValue == Value, State.Failure == Failure {
  /// The state type for your operation.
  associatedtype State: OperationState

  /// an ``OperationPath`` that uniquely identifies your operation.
  ///
  /// If your operation conforms to Hashable or Identifiable, then this requirement is implemented by
  /// default. However, if you want to take advantage of pattern matching, then you'll want to
  /// implement this requirement manually.
  ///
  /// See <doc:PatternMatchingAndStateManagement> for more.
