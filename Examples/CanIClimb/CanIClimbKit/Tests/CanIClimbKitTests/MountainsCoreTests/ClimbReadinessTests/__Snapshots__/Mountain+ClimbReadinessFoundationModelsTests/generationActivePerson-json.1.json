    "insight" : "Based on your active activity level and daily workouts, you have a good foundation for climbing, but there are areas where you can improve. Freel Peak is a difficult climb, and while you're active, your physical readiness might be lacking in key areas. To prepare adequately, consider incorporating more endurance training, strength workouts, and altitude acclimatization exercises into your routine. Increasing your VO2 max and building muscle strength will significantly enhance your climbing performance. Also, ensure you're properly hydrated and maintain a balanced diet to support your training. Preparation is key to tackling a challenging climb like Freel Peak safely and effectively.",
