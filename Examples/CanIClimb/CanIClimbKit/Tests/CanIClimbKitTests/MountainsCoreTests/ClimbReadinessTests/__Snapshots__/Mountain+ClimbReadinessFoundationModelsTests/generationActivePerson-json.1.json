    "insight" : "Based on your active activity level and daily workout routine, you've shown a reasonable level of fitness for a challenging climb. However, you should consider doing some preparation climbs to build your stamina further, especially on steep inclines. Increasing your weekly mileage and incorporating interval training will help improve your cardiovascular endurance and strength. Aim for a balanced diet with sufficient protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates to fuel your training. Stay hydrated, especially as you approach your climb, and listen to your body to avoid overtraining.",
