However, there are areas that could be improved to ensure readiness for Freel Peak, which is rated as 'Difficult'. To better prepare, consider incorporating more endurance training, particularly in climbing or hiking, to build stamina. Also, you might benefit from strength training to handle the physical demands of the climb. As you prepare, pay attention to your nutrition, ensuring you maintain energy levels for longer treks.
