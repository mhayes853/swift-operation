However, with a difficulty rating of 72 out of 100, you will need to focus on improving cardiovascular endurance and strength, especially given that most precipitation on Freel Peak falls as snow. Consider doing preparation climbs of similar difficulty to build your stamina. Also, it might be wise to invest in proper gear for snowy conditions.",
