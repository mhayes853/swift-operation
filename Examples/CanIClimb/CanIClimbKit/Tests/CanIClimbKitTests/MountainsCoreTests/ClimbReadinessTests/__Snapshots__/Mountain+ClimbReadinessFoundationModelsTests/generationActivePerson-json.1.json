However, your climbing difficulty rating is 72 out of 100, indicating that you will likely encounter significant challenges. To improve your readiness, consider incorporating more climbing-specific exercises, such as interval training and strength training focused on your legs and core. Also, try to acclimatize to higher altitudes gradually by doing shorter climbs with longer rests to get your body used to the elevation changes.",
