    "insight" : "Based on your partially ready rating, here are some preparation tips to enhance your climbing readiness. First, focus on gradually increasing your cardio fitness through regular cardiovascular exercise. Incorporate activities like running, cycling, or swimming into your routine at least 3-4 times a week to improve your VO2 max. Second, consider strength training exercises to build muscle endurance and support your body during the climb. Incorporate weightlifting and bodyweight exercises 2-3 times a week, targeting major muscle groups. Third, enhance your flexibility and balance with activities such as yoga or dynamic stretching, ideally 2-3 times a week to reduce the risk of injury. Lastly, plan a series of easier climbs to acclimate to the physical demands. Start with local hikes or trails that match or slightly exceed the difficulty of Freel Peak, gradually increasing the challenge as you build endurance and strength. Consult with a fitness professional to tailor a program that suits your current fitness level and progress.",
