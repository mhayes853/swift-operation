    "insight" : "Based on your VO2 Max of 33.4 ml\/kg\/min, you have a moderate aerobic capacity. However, with a sedentary activity level and no exercise routine, your cardiovascular fitness and overall endurance are below optimal for climbing Freel Peak. Freel Peak is rated as a difficult climb with a difficulty rating of 72 out of 100. To prepare, start with regular cardio exercises like brisk walking, jogging, or cycling for at least 3-4 times a week to gradually build your stamina. Incorporate strength training exercises 2-3 times a week to improve muscle endurance and support your joints. Increase your weekly distance traveled by 20-30% each week to simulate climbing conditions. Prioritize a balanced diet rich in carbohydrates, healthy fats, and proteins to fuel your body. Ensure adequate rest and recovery to prevent injury. Gradually acclimate to altitude by simulating high-altitude conditions if possible, such as through specific climbing training or gradual hikes.",
